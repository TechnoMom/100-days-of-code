# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: Monday, 4 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started the Credit Card Checker project at [Codecademy][https://codecademy.com] and began going through the ES6 lessons at [FreeCodeCamp][https://freecodecamp.org]. Read the first two chapters of [Eloquent JavaScript, Third Edition][https://eloquentjavascript.net], by Marijn Haverbeke.

**Thoughts**: I'm frustrated with finding not-working links (not 404s, but material that has moved behind a paywall) in Codecademy's curriculum. I report them, of course, but it seems that they could do a better job of checking on such things. And I think that I'm making the credit card checker project more difficult than it needs to be.

### Day 1: Sunday, 3 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: Studied JavaScript at [FreeCodeCamp][https://freecodecamp.org] and [Codecademy][https://codecademy.com]. Completed Basic JavaScript at FCC and went back over loops and objects at Codecademy.

**Thoughts**: I seem to have a mental block regarding objects and recursion. I keep going over them but haven't gotten the material to truly click yet.

**Link to work:** n/a
