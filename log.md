# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: Thursday, 7 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: Studied git and regular expressions.

**Thoughts**: I'm tired. I think it is largely due to current events. I still got in my hour, though!

### Day 4: Wednesday, 6 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started the Mysterious Organism project on Codecademy and started on Regular Expressions at FCC. 

**Thoughts**: I would have spent more time on both sections, but today's news of insurrection is very distracting - and I have a D&D game tonight! But I did get my hour in.

### Day 3: Tuesday, 5 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished everything but the optional bits of the Credit Card Checker project, but I'm not quite happy with it yet. Also went through FCC's ES6 lessons.

**Thoughts**: If I were commuting to and from work this just wouldn't be possible. Being able to do it is a pandemic blessing.

### Day 2: Monday, 4 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started the Credit Card Checker project at [Codecademy][https://codecademy.com] and began going through the ES6 lessons at [FreeCodeCamp][https://freecodecamp.org]. Read the first two chapters of [Eloquent JavaScript, Third Edition][https://eloquentjavascript.net], by Marijn Haverbeke.

**Thoughts**: I'm frustrated with finding not-working links (not 404s, but material that has moved behind a paywall) in Codecademy's curriculum. I report them, of course, but it seems that they could do a better job of checking on such things. And I think that I'm making the credit card checker project more difficult than it needs to be.

### Day 1: Sunday, 3 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: Studied JavaScript at [FreeCodeCamp][https://freecodecamp.org] and [Codecademy][https://codecademy.com]. Completed Basic JavaScript at FCC and went back over loops and objects at Codecademy.

**Thoughts**: I seem to have a mental block regarding objects and recursion. I keep going over them but haven't gotten the material to truly click yet.

**Link to work:** n/a
