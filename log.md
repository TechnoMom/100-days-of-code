# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 18: Wednesday, 20 January 2921

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued with the Full Stack Development Path on Codecademy, focusing on a project called Excursion. 

**Thoughts**: The Inauguration today was such a relief! I have been able to focus so much better ever since it was finished/

### Day 17: Tuesday, 19 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I did several sections of the Full-Stack Engineer course at Codecademy, including a project.

**Thoughts**: I think the projects help to solidify knowledge more than anything else does.

### Day 16: Monday, 18 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: I spent most of my time today studying Flexbox.

**Thoughts**: Does anyone else occasionally feel like your brain is just full and you need a break?

### Day 15: Sunday, 17 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: CSS. Lots of CSS. And more CSS.

**Thoughts**: Is there more CSS than there used to be? It sure seems like it.

### Day 14: Saturday, 16 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: I moved on to a CSS review as well as reviewing some JavaScript at Codecademy. Still studying JavaScript at FCC.

**Thoughts**: I had to get up early Friday and then skipped lunch due to work stuff. The combination led to crashing before posting this update last night! But I did get my time in and I continued to study today.

### Day 13: Friday, 15 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: I'm mostly done with the Web Development Fundamentals review at Codecademy. Still working on JavaScript at FCC.

### Day 12: Thursday, 14 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: More Web Development Fundamentals review at Codecademy and going through the Basic Algorithm Scripting at FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I've raced through things in the past, but I'm trying to slow down to retain more now.

### Day 11: Wednesday, 13 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: More of the Basic Algorithm Scripting and Web Development Fundamentals review.

**Thoughts**: It's D&D night, so I didn't have as much time to study. But I did get my hour in, then had some pure fun.

### Day 10: Tuesday, 12 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: I started the Basic Algorithm Scripting at FCC and did more Web Development Fundamentals review at Codecademy.

**Thoughts**: I think I'm going to take the algorithms slowly. I want to be sure that I really understand them.

### Day 9: Monday, 11 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: So far, I've done the Basic Data Structures at FCC and started the Web Development part of the Full-Stack Engineer path at Codecademy.

**Thoughts**: I'm making use of insomnia and getting my time in early today.

### Day 8: Sunday, 10 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through the Full-Stack Engineer path at Codecademy and did the Mixed Messages project. Went through the Debugging Challenges at FCC.

**Thoughts**: I forgot to do my log and Tweet on Sunday, but I did get more than an hour of study/coding in!

### Day 7: Saturday, 9 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: Spent more time on Git and GitHub at Codecademy. Finished up Regular Expressions at FCC (though that topic bears a lot more study).

**Thoughts**: Too many videos! I just don't like watching videos. I find it harder to focus on them than text or (particularly) exercises/challenges.

### Day 6: Friday, 8 Jannuary 2021

**Today's Progress**: Studied Git, GitHub, and regular expessions.

**Thoughts**: What a week! But I am still going strong.

### Day 5: Thursday, 7 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: Studied Git and regular expressions.

**Thoughts**: I'm tired. I think it is largely due to current events. I still got in my hour, though!

### Day 4: Wednesday, 6 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started the Mysterious Organism project on Codecademy and started on Regular Expressions at FCC. 

**Thoughts**: I would have spent more time on both sections, but today's news of insurrection is very distracting - and I have a D&D game tonight! But I did get my hour in.

### Day 3: Tuesday, 5 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished everything but the optional bits of the Credit Card Checker project, but I'm not quite happy with it yet. Also went through FCC's ES6 lessons.

**Thoughts**: If I were commuting to and from work this just wouldn't be possible. Being able to do it is a pandemic blessing.

### Day 2: Monday, 4 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started the Credit Card Checker project at [Codecademy][https://codecademy.com] and began going through the ES6 lessons at [FreeCodeCamp][https://freecodecamp.org]. Read the first two chapters of [Eloquent JavaScript, Third Edition][https://eloquentjavascript.net], by Marijn Haverbeke.

**Thoughts**: I'm frustrated with finding not-working links (not 404s, but material that has moved behind a paywall) in Codecademy's curriculum. I report them, of course, but it seems that they could do a better job of checking on such things. And I think that I'm making the credit card checker project more difficult than it needs to be.

### Day 1: Sunday, 3 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: Studied JavaScript at [FreeCodeCamp][https://freecodecamp.org] and [Codecademy][https://codecademy.com]. Completed Basic JavaScript at FCC and went back over loops and objects at Codecademy.

**Thoughts**: I seem to have a mental block regarding objects and recursion. I keep going over them but haven't gotten the material to truly click yet.

**Link to work:** n/a
